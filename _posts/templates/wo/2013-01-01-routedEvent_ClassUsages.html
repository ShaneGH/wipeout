        <p>Routed events are similar to events, however, when triggered they bubble up the visual tree until handled. Some of the differences between events and routed events are as follows</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Routed events are generally static. That way various object instances can subscribe to the same event and catch it if it bubbles past.</li>
            <li>Routed events must be triggered by a wo.visual. If not handled by subscribers to this event on this visual, the event will bubble up to the parent of the visual until handled or the DOM root is reached</li>
        </ul>
