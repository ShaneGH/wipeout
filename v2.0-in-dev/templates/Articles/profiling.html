<h1>Profiling</h1>

<p>Wipeout has a built in rough and ready profiler. To open it, just open a console window and type <code>wipeout.profile.profile()</code>. Try it on this site!<br/>
    With the profiler you can:
<ul>
    <li>Highlight view model html by hovering over it</li>
    <li>View the hierarchy of view models by honding ctrl+click (does not always work with clickable items in IE)</li>
    <li>View the rendering, initialization and template compile time of each view model. In order to see these stats, profiling must be turned on
    before the item is rendered, so before you call <code>ko.applyBindings(...)</code></li>
    <li>Debug the view model and model objects themselves, by opening a console window and clicking on a view model header</li>
    <li>Turn off proiling by calling <code>wipeout.profile.profile(false)</code>.</li>
</ul>
