<h1>Models</h1>

<p>The role of the model object is generally to hold the business logic and business data of the application. It shold NEVER concern itself with appearence or manipulate the DOM. A definitive guide to the
role of a model is beyond the scope of this document.</p>

<p>In wipeout, a model manifests as a special property of the view model. It is special in two ways:
    <ol>
        <li>
            Unless explicitely set to null, every view model is gaurenteed to have a model. This is because models cascade downwards. If you do not have the model set on a view model, it will 
            be assigned the model of it's parent.
            <wipeout-docs.view-models.components.code-block>
        <code>&lt;wo.content-control model="'Hello wipeout!'">
    &lt;template>
        &lt;wo.content-control>
            &lt;template>
                &lt;div data-bind="text: model">(This text will be replaced by "Hello wipeout!")&lt;/div>
            &lt;/template>
        &lt;/wo.content-control>
    &lt;/template>
&lt;/wo.content-control></code>
    </wipeoutDocs.viewModels.components.codeBlock>
            In this example the second contentControl has bee automatically given the model of its parent
        </li>
        <li>
            There is a pre defined hook <wipeout.rl href="'/wipeout/## insert: site-directory ##/api.html?type=api&amp;className=wo.view&amp;functionName=onModelChanged&amp;isStatic=false'" text="'onModelChanged'" /> which 
            can be overridden in derived view models to get a notification each time a model changes.
        </li>
    </ol>
</p>
<p>
    The model is driver of you applicaiton. It is the object passed into the <code>ko.applyBindings(...)</code> function which kicks off the entire wipeout process.
