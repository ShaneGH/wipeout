<h1>Orienteer</h1>

<p>
	Orienteer is a very simple Object Oriented Programming (OOP) (TODOD: link) library which is included with wipeout.
</p>
<p>
If OOP isn't your thing, don't worry, it is used under the hood but is an optional method of creating wipeout view models.<br/>
If you like OOP, check out the docs <a href="https://github.com/ShaneGH/orienteer">here</a>.
