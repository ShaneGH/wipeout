itemsControl binding, still creating " ko " comments

If html element is deleted outside of wo, dispose of its associated view

Roadmap:
Big cleanup, unit testing, commenting, disposal of objects/observables, refactoring if needed
Debug code

If, poke template




seperate template ids for each item in items control
add __createdByWipeout to each item created by items control
ic-render => wpfko.bindings.render.init.call(this, element, valueAccessor, allBindingsAccessor, bindingContext.$parent, bindingContext.$parentContext);
