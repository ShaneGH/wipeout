Force all attributes to start with "wo-" (like wo-click=...)

Try to make onModelChanged synchronus. Model routed events don't work properly if it is async

REMOVE WITH. It is incredibly slow

events and routed events. make strings?s

replace xml parsing with native

<div content--s="hello"></div> doesn't work. Parsers only work with view models


standardise the way things are rendered, between Objects and wo.views (toString)

<Array>
    <value parser="s">A</value>
    <value parser="s">Random</value>
    <value parser="s">Object</value>
    <value parser="s">2</value>
</Array>

initialization/disposal overrides. Needs complete overhaul

bug, handle null template id better

window.requestAnimationFrame

profiler

TODO:   wipeout.base.watched.prototype.observe, do something with dispose function from watch
        wipeout.base.watched.prototype.observe/watch, unit test dispose functionality

Alter xml engine to use RegExp(/something/g).lastIndex
