wo-checked htmlAttr/wo-value refactor???

Types of todos:
TODV: in later version
TODE: exception handling
TODM: document

wo() => make sure elements aren't wo'ed twice
audit deletes

refactor _caching to use disposable

view model constructor context (defualt = window)

html event handled

Try to make onModelChanged synchronus. Model routed events don't work properly if it is async

events and routed events. make strings

standardise the way things are rendered, between Objects and wo.views (toString)

for html/css developers: wo.removeAllCommentNodes(), wo.replaceAllCommentNodes()


bug, handle null template id better

window.requestAnimationFrame

shadow DOM/DocumentFragment

profiler
