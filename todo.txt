1: re-introduce commented tests
2: test -	setter, compiledInitializer, builder, context??



look at console.logs in tests

Try to make onModelChanged synchronus. Model routed events don't work properly if it is async

REMOVE WITH. It is incredibly slow

tests with useObjectOberve === false will fail

events and routed events. make strings?s

replace xml parsing with native

Test template engine, render context, renderedContent and viewModelElement
View model namespace overhaul and tests

standardise the way things are rendered, between Objects and wo.views (toString)

<Array>
    <value parser="s">A</value>
    <value parser="s">Random</value>
    <value parser="s">Object</value>
    <value parser="s">2</value>
</Array>

on swap-xml-parser branch, try tp protect against "<wo.view />" errors

initialization/disposal overrides. Needs complete overhaul

for html/css developers: wo.removeAllCommentNodes(), wo.replaceAllCommentNodes()


bug, handle null template id better

window.requestAnimationFrame

shadow DOM

profiler

there is a lot of camelcasing. Is there a single point of failure I can use here?

Alter xml engine to use RegExp(/something/g).lastIndex

html events
filters
