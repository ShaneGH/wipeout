html event handled
wrap domData in htmlAttributeSetter, use to chain attrs.
	can I get over ordering?
	do value binding onblur, onchange, onkeyup etc
	do radio button and checkbox value


look at console.logs in tests

Try to make onModelChanged synchronus. Model routed events don't work properly if it is async

REMOVE WITH. It is incredibly slow

tests with useObjectOberve === false will fail

events and routed events. make strings

standardise the way things are rendered, between Objects and wo.views (toString)

on swap-xml-parser branch, try tp protect against "<wo.view />" errors

for html/css developers: wo.removeAllCommentNodes(), wo.replaceAllCommentNodes()


bug, handle null template id better

window.requestAnimationFrame

shadow DOM

profiler
