Try to make onModelChanged synchronus. Model routed events don't work properly if it is async

REMOVE WITH. It is incredibly slow

tests with useObjectOberve === false will fail

events and routed events. make strings?s

replace xml parsing with native

remove templateItems object, place items directly on the vm

Test template engine, render context, renderedContent and viewModelElement
View model namespace overhaul and tests

standardise the way things are rendered, between Objects and wo.views (toString)

<Array>
    <value parser="s">A</value>
    <value parser="s">Random</value>
    <value parser="s">Object</value>
    <value parser="s">2</value>
</Array>

initialization/disposal overrides. Needs complete overhaul

for html/css developers: wo.removeAllCommentNodes(), wo.replaceAllCommentNodes()


bug, handle null template id better

obsjs.disposable, lazy create disposables object
obsjs.array, push with multiple arguments does not work
obsjs.path, try to allow this kind of thing "obj.getSomething().value"

window.requestAnimationFrame

shadow DOM

profiler

there is a lot of camelcasing. Is there a single point of failure I can use here?

Alter xml engine to use RegExp(/something/g).lastIndex
