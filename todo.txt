itemsControl binding, still creating " ko " comments

If html element is deleted outside of wo, dispose of its associated view

Roadmap:
Big cleanup, unit testing, commenting, disposal of objects/observables, refactoring if needed
Debug code

If, poke template
explicit disposeal of binding

when a vm is created give it a __createdByTemplateEngine property
if true, call dispose() on unRender, else call unRender()

on unrender hook
