REMOVE WITH. It is incredibly slow


synchronus rendering if template is defined beforehand (or maybe if not)

events and routed events. make strings?

owts binding
owts is valid regex


array change, do not calculate if there are no args

integrate array bind into arrayChangeCompiler.process

replace xml parsing with native

do not use computeds in bindings.
<div content--s="hello"></div> doesn't work. Parsers only work with view models

$index

standardise the way things are rendered, between Objects and wo.views (toString)

<Array>
    <value parser="s">A</value>
    <value parser="s">Random</value>
    <value parser="s">Object</value>
    <value parser="s">2</value>
</Array>

initialization/disposal overrides. Needs complete overhaul

bug, handle null template id better

window.requestAnimationFrame

profiler

TODO:   wipeout.base.watched.prototype.observe, do something with dispose function from watch
        wipeout.base.watched.prototype.observe/watch, unit test dispose functionality

there is a lot of camelcasing. Is there a single point of failure I can use here?

Alter xml engine to use RegExp(/something/g).lastIndex
